# Watchman

## What is it?

A core set of utilities frequently used in large data processing / ML projects, exposed as REST endpoints. Want to extract text from HTML?... we've got it. Caption a set of images scraped from the web?... this is your place. Extract entities with MITIE or Stanford NER. Yes please.

## Dependencies

1. Node 4
1. Strongloop 2
1. Bower
1. Docker 1.12
1. Python 2.7 + 3.5

## Dev boostrap

```
# get working copy of .env file from a friend
npm i -g strongloop bower
npm i
# only if models change...
lb-ng server/server.js client/js/lb-services.js
```

## Install with Docker Compose

```
docker -v # must be 1.12+
